This repository contains the various molecular simulation datasets created and used by the Siepmann group. Please view the readme file for each individual dataset folder for their information.

The name of the repository is given such that the datasets are mainly generated from molecular simulations using the [MCCCS-MN](http://siepmann.chem.umn.edu/software) software.
